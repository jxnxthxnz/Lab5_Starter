1. No, I would not use a unit test for the "message" feature as that is far too complex. A message may include so many different things from the language used, emoticons, length, etc. A unit test simply tests a small portion of code, so it would not be ideal to test out the entire message feature.

2. Yes, I would use a unit test for the "message length" feature. I would simply needed to test if the message exceeds some arbitrary length that I dictate. Testing only one singular aspect is perfect for unit testing.
